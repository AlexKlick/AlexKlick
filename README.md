Hi, I'm a software engineer who enjoys the journey of learning and developing new skills. I have always had a love of science and the scientific method. In college, I studied mathematics and economics and came to the realization that science without philosophy can be a hollow endeavor. It drove me to question my assumptions about life and what my goals are. I know now that I have a passion for building things and take pride in putting my best work forward. Through learning at Turing School Of Software Design, I got to meet and collaborate with some truly talented and intelligent engineers. This journey has been both enlightening and humbling as I've discovered my calling in life. 

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading and watching sci-fi, hiking, skiing and playing soccer. I also really love healthy discussion, and pinging ideas back and forth with other people. I believe that the greatest growth can be achieved by learning from those who challenge us to view the world differently. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “In my walks, every man I meet is my superior in some way, and in that I learn from him.” I try my best to live by this philosophy. 

I am currently working on becoming the best Ruby on Rails and SQL programmer I can be. I believe that the best back end will allow for rapid and unencumbered front end development. I also enjoy full stack development with experience building apps in react. I also dabble a little in python and find machine learning to be especially cool! My background in math and econ exposed me to some of the statistical concepts and this is an area that I would enjoy slowly gaining some more knowledge in!
